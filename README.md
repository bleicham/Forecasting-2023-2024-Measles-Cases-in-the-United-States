[1] contains additional details related to the employed modeling methodology. The data is also displayed in a dashboard: . The data displayed in the dashboard and used for all forecasts is obtained each Friday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2]. New forecasts are updated each Friday.
